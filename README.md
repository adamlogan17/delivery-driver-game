# delivery-driver-game

This is a basic delivery game made within Unity using C#. 

It is currently a work in progress but should still be functional. The packages will spawn infornt of a random house and, once collected, the delivery destination will spawn at a different house. The yellow cylinder is used to increase the user's speed but once a user collides with an object the speed of the user will decrease.

The score counter is displayed in the top right corner and displays the colour of the next package to be collected.

This is still a work in progress but this is a functioning version.
