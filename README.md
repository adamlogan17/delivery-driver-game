# delivery-driver-game

This is a basic delivery game made within Unity using C#. 

It is currently a work in progress but should still be functional. The packages will spawn infornt of a random house and, once collected, the delivery destination will spawn at a different house. The yellow cylinder is used to increase the user's speed but once a user collides with an object the speed of the user will decrease.
